Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open/Closed Principle
Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

 Single Responsibility Principle: This principle states that “a class should have only one reason to change”
 Open/Closed Principle: This principle states that “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification” which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.
 Liskov’s Substitution Principle: The principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and according to this principle “Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes“.
 Interface Segregation Principle: This principle is the first principle that applies to Interfaces instead of classes in SOLID and it is similar to the single responsibility principle. It states that “do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them“. 
 Dependency Inversion Principle: Before we discuss this topic keep in mind that Dependency Inversion and Dependency Injection both are different concepts. Most of the people get confused about it and consider both are the same. Now two key points are here to keep in mind about this principle

High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
